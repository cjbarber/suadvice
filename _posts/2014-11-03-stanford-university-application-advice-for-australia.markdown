This site currently has no content, intentionally.

Want to get help or tips on applying to Stanford?

I can give extra tips to people who fit into any of the following categories:

 - from Australia
 - from other international countries
 - into startups

The only condition: I will happily talk to anyone on Skype for 15 minutes, however, you will be required to write up the content of our conversation so that I may post it on this website. It will then be searchable for everyone!
